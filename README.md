"Prompt Rose" is a tool that, with just a press and hold of the Ctrl key, brings up a radial menu similar to those found in the Battlefield game series. However, instead of game commands, this menu is filled with quick prompt instructions specifically designed for Large Language Models (LLMs). This eliminates the need for users to search through their notebooks for prompts.  Designed for Windows platforms, "Prompt Rose" also allows for prompt management directly from the right-click system tray.
